I purchased a 2015 Ford Transit in June of 2018 with the intent of turning it into a campervan to live in. I designed the electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling, and cooking systems and I've started construction. I’m saving every receipt for every tool and material that I’ve purchased along the way and I will be documenting the build process right here!

You can see a short video clip of the design in the Instagram post below, and some more photos of the build on my personal instagram page.
