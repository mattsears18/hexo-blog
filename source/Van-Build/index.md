I purchased a 2015 Ford Transit in June of 2018 with the intent of turning it into a campervan to live in. I have designed the electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling, and cooking systems and I’ve started construction. I’m saving every receipt for every tool and material that I’ve purchased along the way and I will be documenting the build process right here!

I likely won’t have time to make many posts about the build until this winter – when it’s too cold to work on the van. In the meantime, you can see a short video clip of the design in the Instagram post below, and some more photos of the build on my personal instagram page.
