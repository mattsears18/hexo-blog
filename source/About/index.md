Hello! I’m Matt and I put this blog together to share some of the interesting things that I’m currently working on. I’m a civil engineer, a web developer, and a woodworker, and I enjoy projects that allow me combine these skillsets. Some things that I’m currently working on:

## Construction Data Services, LLC

In May of 2019, [Guillermo Nevett](https://guillermonevett.github.io/) and I launched [Construction Data Services](https://condataservices.com) (CDS). CDS provides custom data analytics and software solutions for construction organizations.

## PhD in Civil Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder

I study construction productivity. Specifically, we’re studying how construction craft workers [view and interpret construction drawings](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319459132_Visualizing_Eye_Tracking_Convex_Hull_Areas_A_Pilot_Study_for_Understanding_How_Craft_Workers_Interpret_2D_Construction_Drawings) (blueprints) with eye tracking technology. Interestingly, there aren’t many metrics/methods for analyzing eye tracking data, so I’m developing some [new metrics/methods](https://www.npmjs.com/package/time-hulls) and packaging them in a [web app](https://github.com/mattsears18/visual-eyes). When the app is finished it will be freely accessible to anyone that wishes to use it.

## Van Build

I bought a 2015 Ford Transit that I currently live in and am converting into a camper van while traveling the country. I’ve designed everything, including: solar electrical system, plumbing system, propane cooking and heating system, etc, basically everything that you would have in a normal home, and construction is currently underway!

## Travel

My current goal is to visit all of the [national parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_the_United_States) and [UNESCO world heritage sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_the_United_States) in the United States, in addition to any other exciting places that I learn about.
