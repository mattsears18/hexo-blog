I use [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/@mattsears18) to tracking my programming activity but it only provides stats on the last 7 days. Over the last few years I've primarily worked with JavaScript, but lately I've been working more with Dart and I worked with PHP a lot in the past. I used [this tool](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-profile-languages) to show all of the languages that I've used over the years in the visualization below.
