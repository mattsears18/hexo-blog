I've been learning quite a bit about [serverless](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/what-is-serverless.html) web development lately and today I came across [Hexo](https://hexo.io)! Hexo is a static site generator that makes developing a blog ridiculously simple. In about two hours, I learned how to use Hexo, generated this blog, commited it to [Github](https://github.com/mattsears18), and served it up through [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

Originally, this blog was a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) blog. WordPress runs on PHP and it requires a database, so I was running a MySQL database through a shared hosting service (translation: it was sloooooooow). Now, [Netlify's CDN](https://www.netlify.com/products/edge/) makes this blog super fast from anywhere in the world, and I no longer have to pay for database or content hosting! The WordPress blog incurred hosting fees of about $100/year, but now that I'm using Hexo and Netlify, my only cost for maintaining this blog is a $22.99/year domain renewal fee. ❤️
