I've been learning quite a bit about serverless web development lately and today I came across [Hexo](https://hexo.io)! Hexo is a static site generator that makes developing a blog ridiculously simple. In about two hours I learned how to use hexo, generated this blog, commited it to Github, and served it up to you through [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Originally, this blog was a WordPress blog that incurred hosting fees of about $100/year, but now that I'm using Hexo and Netlify, my only cost for maintaining this blog is a $22.99/year domain renewal fee.
